to do: 
refactor functions in to one that i pass in parameters? 
makle custom paintjob a ticker below select list +8 for full +5 for mini. group all in one span?
------------
document.getElementById("mainForm").children
-------------
after cloning the code, run npm install (if its the first time) 
then npm start anytime you want to "launch" the website on your local machine
-------------------
since the functions in index.ts are not global to be accessed by the html file, you must open "react.declarations.d.ts"
 and interface 'Window' to declare the functions as void, then redefine them in terms of window in index.ts

index.ts: 
window.buttonTest = function buttonTest() {
  console.log("run buttonTest");
  document.getElementById("yoink").innerHTML = 'it worked';
};

react.declarations.d.ts:
interface Window {
    buttonTest: () => void,
  }

-----------------
build your list of questions in html, then copy it (tags and all) to your TS file and define it as a string. 
that way you can append/remove chunks of html code easily
-------------
load in a set of questions on start automatically

window.onload = document.onload = () => {
 console.log('Logged on document ready');   
}
